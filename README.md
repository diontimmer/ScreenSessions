# ScreenSessions
 Flask Web UI for GNU Screen. List, create, and kill screen sessions in a graphical interface (GUI).<br>
 Install requirements.txt using your interpreter, and run it as a flask app by running the command: ```flask run``` in the script root folder.<br>
 If you're feeling risky, you can whitelist scripts/commands in the config.json for you to run in the containers. DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br>
 Flask has arguments which you can append to the startup command for more control.
